# CTF365
Practise CTF every day!

## About
We setup this repo for CTF lovers, and especially for the beginners.
As you know, it is not easy to have all of the games running properly at the same time. So if you find anything unexpected, contact us or leave an issue.
Once you break into some environments, please do not try to do damage. On the other hand, we will spare no effort to keep everything under our control.

We now supply a [platform](http://fdu.6stars.cf/ctfcircle) __IN FUDAN INTERNAL NETWORK__ for you to submit the flag you find. Notice that the invite code at registry is not neccessary.

## Flag
In order to get away from unnecessary trouble, we decide to unify the format of flags.

Most flags submitted should be wrapped with `*ctf{}`.
If a flag is not surrounded by curly braces, please wrap it with `*ctf{}` when submit.
If a flag is surrounded by an unusual tag and curly braces, keep it intact.

## Useful Tools
Due to the Chinese GFW, it can be slow to download some tools. So we downloaded them and stored them on our server. You can find those tools on http://fdu.6stars.cf/res/ . __THIS SITE IS ONLY ACCESSIBLE FROM FUDAN INTERNAL NETWORK__.

If you need any tool which is outside the wall and you cannot get it, leave an issue.
